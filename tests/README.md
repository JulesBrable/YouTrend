# WARNING: UNIT TESTING ISSUES

At the time these tests were written, the current repository was perceived as a package and had a significantly different structure. 
Trust me, they were functioning well (all the tests passed perfectly...almost). However, they now exist more as a formality. 
Reconsideration of the module importation within the framework is necessary to guarantee both extensibility and compatibility with Docker for containerization.
